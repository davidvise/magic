        <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.</p>
        <p>Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.</p>
        <p>A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>
        <p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.</p>

        <p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen.</p>
        <p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.</p>
        <p>When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.</p>

        <p>Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.</p>
        <p>The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.</p>
        <p>But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again.</p>
